# Balls
Written in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. The program needs exactly five integers as arguments. Specifically, L1: durability of Basketball's ball, L2: durability of Tennis' ball, L3: durability of Ping-pong's ball, N: total amount of balls and K: total amount of actions (hit/rest). Assumptions: 1) L1>L2>L3, 2) a ball is worn when it's durability is less than or equal to zero, 3) we can't rest a Basketball's ball, 4) a ball can be hidden after a hit with probability 10%, 5) a ping-pong's ball can be broken after a hit with probability 10%, if the ball isn't already hidden, 6) can't hit a hidden ball, 7) can't hit a broken ball (only in ping-pong case), 8) a ball is playable if and only if it's durability is greater than zero. Contains makefile: make to compile and make clean to delete object files and executable. Keywords: virtual, pure virtual, abstract class, inheritance, encapsulation, initializer list.
